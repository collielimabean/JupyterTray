JupyterTray
===========

JupyterTray is a small tray application to automatically spin off IJulia Jupyter.
I created this because I thought it was annoying that running Jupyter for IJulia
created a persistent cmd window.

To make this work, create a new user environment variable `JULIAPRO_HOME` to your
Julia Pro installation directory. Everything else should just work.
